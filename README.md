## Colors from Clipboard
Goal of this is to have a simple electron app that will allow me to paste an image from the clipboard and automatically identify all the colors in that image.

 - [x] paste from clipboard, display image
 - [x] list colors used
    - [x] hexidecimal
    - [x] RGB
    - [x] sort list by colors usage  
    - [x] click to copy hex or rgb to clipboard

## install
`npm install`

## run
`npm start`
