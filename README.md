## Goal of this is to have a simple electron app that will allow me to paste an image from the clipboard and automatically identify all the colors in that image.

 - [ ] paste from clipboard, display image
 - [ ] list colors used
    - [ ] hexidecimal
    - [ ] RGB
    - [ ] sort list by colors usage
